Here are the results for the written function f(x) = ln(x) + x:
The provided values were: 100, 50, 10, 0
Inputting those values in the function gave the following results:
f(100) = -5.39483
f(50) = -3.15904
f(10) = -0.859693
f(0) = -inf
We used the Newton-Raphson algorithm to find the x values such that f(x) = 0
We found that f(-34.8707) = 0
